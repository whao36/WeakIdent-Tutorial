# WeakIdent-Tutorial
WeakIdent is a powerful framework for identifying the governing differential equations of a system using spatiotemporal data. By leveraging the weak form of differential equations and incorporating sparse optimization techniques, WeakIdent achieves robust and interpretable results even in the presence of noise.

This repository provides a comprehensive tutorial on how to use WeakIdent for your own projects. For a detailed explanation of the model and its methodologies, please refer to their original paper at arXiv:2211.03134. 

The tutorial is divided into two parts:

1. Data Preparation for WeakIdent: This section provides code for simulating spatiotemporal data from a given differential equation and formatting the data (simulated or provided) for identification.
2. PDE Identification using WeakForm: This section includes code for identifying governing equations from the data prepared in the first part.
Both tutorials are presented as well-commented and highly readable Jupyter notebooks. Readers will gain a clear understanding of WeakIdent's implementation and can easily experiment by modifying the provided code and parameters.

It is recommended to run the tutorials on Google Colab, with a linked Google Drive account to store the data generated in the first part, which will be used in the second part.

# WeakIdent-Tutorial
The WeakIdent model identifies governing differential equations of a system from spatiotemporal data using the weak form of equations and sparse optimization techniques. This repository includes readable tutorial for doing data preparation and identification using WeakIdent. For details, see their paper at arXiv:2211.03134.
